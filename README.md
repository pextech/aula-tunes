### Objective

In a fictional world, Aula Education has branched into the music business and we have launched a new web application. However it has some problems and is lacking features. This music app displays the top 100 songs based on the iTunes API and lets you search the results.

### Design Preview

### Existing codebase

* `frontend`: client side rendered React SPA.
* `backend`: Express server skeleton that will come in handy for one of your tasks. The server connects to an in-memory MongoDB store to simulate the persistence layer of the application.
